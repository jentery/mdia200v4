# Portfolio 

This portfolio covers all material from MDIA 200. Your response is due via Brightspace by Monday, April 14th, at 10am.

The portfolio is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use handouts, the course website, my slides, your notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

## Format

This open-book assignment contains *one* prompt, and you may respond to it in *one* of two ways: 

* **Option 1**: text plus images and/or audio, using no more than 1250 words 
* **Option 2**: 5-12 minutes of video 

Your response is worth 100 points and 25% of your final grade. 

## The Prompt 

Tell someone you know what you learned in this course by sharing samples of your work, demonstrating your knowledge of media, and communicating your primary interests in Media Studies. 

* *Identify someone* you know who is interested in what you're learning. This person cannot be me. They could be a friend, family member, partner, (potential) employer, UVic student or instructor, elder, (potential) collaborator . . . The choice is yours, as long as you compose for *one* interlocutor. Indeed, your response to this prompt is an interpersonal communication. 
* *Select four answers* you composed in response to prompts from Worksheets 1-4. You needn't select one answer from each of the four worksheets; however, your four selections should address the course's three modules of study: communication, media, and critical approaches to media and communication. I recommend selecting four answers that taught you a lot about yourself *and* the course topics. I also recommend demonstrating a range of learning (over time, across topics, through various media). 
* *Show or share your work* by including samples of all four answers. Include parts of the answers themselves and point your interlocutor to aspects of them. Showcase what you did and what you learned. Use your work to spark conversation with your interlocutor. You might even ask them questions.  
* *Demonstrate your knowledge* of media by using terminology, techniques, and practices from MDIA 200 in ways your interlocutor would understand. Meet them where they are and decode things for them if need be. 
* *Communicate your primary interests* in Media Studies by selecting *one* critical approach (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a)) we studied this term that appeals most to you. Explain that approach and its appeal but also convey their relevance to work you might do in the future. Give your interlocutor a palpable sense of how and where you could apply what you learned in MDIA 200. 

Your response to this prompt should be *synthetic*. Avoid lists and point form. Construct a narrative or theme that brings the material together in a way that engages your interlocutor on an interpersonal, one-to-one level. The response should be more about you and your learning than the course itself, and it should sound like part of a dialogue rather than an advertisement for MDIA 200. 

You needn't name, describe, photograph, or record your interlocutor; however, I should be able to infer *who they are to you* based on how you communicate with them in response to this prompt. Use references and language that make that relationship clear. 

## Assessment 

I will use the following criteria and [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to assess your response. 

The degree to which your response: 

* Addresses the prompt. 
* Applies course terminology, techniques, and practices to demonstrate what you know and what you learned. 
* Contains a variety of media (such as text, images, audio, and video) that demonstrate what you know and what you learned.
* Communicates what you learned from media practice in this course.
* Communicates what you learned from media analysis in this course.  
* Synthesizes what you learned in this course. 
* Demonstrates an awareness of your interlocutor and how you're communicating with them. 
* Demonstrates and communicates how you might apply what you learned in this course. 
* Makes compelling use of concrete examples across a range of what's available (over time, across topics, through various media). 

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, PDF, MP4, or MOV file containing your response. You are also welcome to attach media files to your submission in Brightspace. 

Do not use a platform other than Brightspace to submit, store, or share your materials. 

## When to Submit It

Your portfolio is due by 10 am on Monday, April 14th.

I will deduct five points for every business day (excluding holidays and weekends) that I receive your portfolio after Tuesday, April 15th at 10am. I will close the submission portal at 10am on Tuesday, April 22nd and cannot accept any submissions after the portal is closed. Thank you for understanding.
