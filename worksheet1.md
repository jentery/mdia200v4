# Worksheet 1

Worksheet 1 covers "The Content Industry" and all material from [Module 1: Communication](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v4/#module-1-communication). Your response is due via Brightspace by Monday, January 27th, at 10am. 

The worksheet is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use handouts, the course website, my slides, your notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

*Please cite your source material.*

## Download the Worksheet 

Please [download the worksheet](mdia200v4Worksheet1.docx) (DOCX format) to complete it in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac.  

## Format

This open-book worksheet contains *five* prompts. You should respond to *four* of them. If you respond to all five, then I will mark the first four. 

Each response is worth 25 points for a total of 100 points. 

Some prompts ask you to create media. Please attach your audio, image, or video files to your response in Brightspace. Do *not* use YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, Google Drive, or any other non-Brightspace platform to submit files. 

## The Five Prompts (Select Four)

**Prompt 1**. Identify a self-employed content creator you follow or are familiar with. Now, find some content (such as a video, image, or podcast episode) they produced and copy the URL for it. Then use no more than 350 words, including terminology from the ["Content Industry"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3159683) handout and any handout in [Module 1: Communication](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v4/#module-1-communication), to share 1) the name of the platform where the content was published, 2) some attention data (such as the number of likes, views, and comments) for the content, 3) how the content creator monetized and moderated the content, 4) how the platform generated revenue from the content, 5) how the content creator addressed toxic behaviours related to the content, 6) how the content creator protected themselves from toxic behaviours (including harassment) related to the content, and 7) what you learned about the labour and economy of the content industry from this exercise. Please include the content's URL or the content itself somewhere in your response. That way, I can access it.

**Prompt 2**. Find an online article that contains an image of two or more people communicating. (Avoid stock images and select an article published by a reputable website.) Now, copy the URL for that article and then write alt text for that image of two or more people communicating. Next, use no more than 350 words, including terminology from the ["Acts of Communication"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3159713) and ["Senses of Communication"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3159716) handouts, to explain 1) the critical decisions you made and 2) what you learned from them while using alt text to a) describe the image's visual and nonverbal elements for someone else to hear and b) account for where on the page the image appears in the article. Please be sure to include the following in your response: 1) the article's URL and 2) your alt text in quotation marks to distinguish it from the rest of your response.

(There is no encoding standard that restricts the length of alt text, but alt text should be succinct. For this exercise, I recommend fewer than 275 characters, which won't count toward your word limit.)

**Prompt 3**. Spend a few minutes listening to [CFUV 101.9 FM](https://cfuv.uvic.ca/) and perusing their website. Then create 30-60 seconds of audio to communicate roughly the same message twice: first to a friend at UVic via a hypothetical voice message or memo (one-to-one) and second to all UVic students via a hypothetical transmission (one-to-many). Next, use no more than 350 words, including terminology from the ["Acts of Communication,"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3159713) ["Means of Communication,"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3167384) and ["Levels of Communication"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3167585) handouts, to explain 1) the *obvious* differences between the two communications, 2) the *subtle* differences between the two communications, and 3) what you learned about context, media, and communication from this exercise. Don't forget to attach your audio file so I can access it.

**Prompt 4**. Identify an advertisement from the 2020s that you interpreted against the grain and then save it, record it, or copy the URL for it. Next, use no more than 350 words, including terminology from the ["Forms of Communication"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3178768) and ["Models of Communication"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3179558) handouts but also any handout in [Module 1: Communication](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v4/#module-1-communication), to explain 1) the advertisement's intended message, 2) a context in which it was encoded, 3) a context in which you decoded it, 4) your negotiated or opposing interpretation of it, 5) the kind of feedback you provided on it, 6) the channel or form of communication you used to provide that feedback, and 7) what you learned about interpretation, media, and communication from this exercise. Don't forget to attach or embed the advertisement so I can access it.

**Prompt 5**. Use 30-90 seconds of video or audio to record two types of noise you encounter in your everyday communications with other people. (Six types of noise appear in the "Examples" section of the ["Miscommunication"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3179982) handout.) Then use no more than 350 words, including terminology from the ["Miscommunication"](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/lessons/365831/topics/3179982) handout and any handout in [Module 1: Communication](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v4/#module-1-communication), to share 1) the two types of noise you identified, 2) descriptions of the two noises, 3) how you personally experience each noise, 4) what each noise tells us about what people want or expect from communication, and 5) what you learned about noise and (mis)communication from this exercise. 

## Assessment 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your responses. 

* 23-25 points (exceeds all expectations of the assignment): the response is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it enriches or enhances the course material, including lectures, handouts, class discussions, and assigned primary sources; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 20-22 points (exceeds some or most expectations of the assignment): the response is compelling and corresponds with the course material, including lectures, handouts, class discussions, and assigned primary sources; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 18-19 points (meets the expectations of the assignment): the response corresponds with the course material, including lectures, handouts, class discussions, and assigned primary sources; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; the use of examples is clear, focused, and occasionally convincing
* 15-17 points (meets some expectations of the assignment): the response corresponds with some of the course material, including lectures, handouts, class discussions, and assigned primary sources; it addresses some or most of the prompt; the use of examples warrants some clarification 
* 1-14 points (does not meet expectations of the assignment): the response does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompt
* 0 points: no response  

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

10 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no references are included at the end of the worksheet (see details below).

The total of these points (0-100) will constitute 20% of your final mark in this course. 

*You do not need to meet the word count in each response to earn a high mark.* 

I recommend using prose (paragraphs) rather than point form in your responses. Prose is more synthetic and will allow you to make connections.

You should also avoid repetition within responses and across them. I do not, for instance, recommend writing about the same topic or theme in every response (e.g., four responses about video games, TikTok, or a particular fandom).

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. This includes course handouts. You are welcome to use your preferred citation style (MLA, Chicago, or APA, e.g.).  

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, or PDF file containing your answers and references along with any media you were prompted to attach or embed. 

## When to Submit It

A response to Worksheet 1 is due by 10am on Monday, January 27th, but there is a 24-hour grace period. I will deduct five points for every business day I receive Worksheet 1 after 10am on Tuesday, January 28th. I will close the submission portal at 10am on Monday, February 10th, and cannot accept any submissions after the portal is closed.
